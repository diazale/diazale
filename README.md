### ðŸ§®ðŸ§¬ I'm Alex, a statistician and data scientist doing PhD research in population genetics ðŸ§¬ðŸ§®

- I'm currently at McGill University finishing my PhD in [Quantitative Life Sciences](https://www.mcgill.ca/qls/)
- I work with [Simon Gravel](https://gravellab.github.io/) studying dimensionality reduction and visualization in population genetics
- I like to study the world through data. Some of my side-projects include [tracking the length of the Rideau Canal skating season](https://github.com/diazale/skateway) and [collecting news stories of traffic violence](https://github.com/diazale/death_by_car)
- You can find my published research on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=CwGsVS0AAAAJ)

__My core research projects__:

### Non-linear dimensionality reduction for visualizing population genetic data

UMAP is an efficient method to visualize biobank data. You can find structure in your data (i.e. (population structure)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_structure_(genetics)]) related to factors like demographic history or biobank sampling methodology. When you colour in the visualizations with other data, like geography or phenotypic measures, you can see lots of patterns and study them further. You can also work in 3D and get creative, doing stuff like converting UMAP's $(x,y,z)$ coordinates to RGB positions to create colour maps.

### Stratification of biobank data

Though UMAP tends to generate clusters, it is not a clustering algorithm. To extract clusters from UMAP data, we use a density-based method called HDBSCAN. We can use this for (stratification)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling] to get a better grasp of the population structure in our data, study how methods like polygenic scores transfer between populations, and do QC on biobank data.
