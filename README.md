### ðŸ§® I'm Alex, a statistician and data scientist doing PhD research in population genetics ðŸ§¬

- I'm currently at McGill University finishing my PhD in [Quantitative Life Sciences](https://www.mcgill.ca/qls/)
- I work with [Simon Gravel](https://gravellab.github.io/) studying dimensionality reduction and visualization in population genetics
- I like to study the world through data. Some of my side-projects include [tracking the length of the Rideau Canal skating season](https://github.com/diazale/skateway) and [collecting news stories of traffic violence](https://github.com/diazale/death_by_car)
